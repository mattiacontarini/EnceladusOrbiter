# Thesis
Repository with documents and code for the thesis.

The code contained in this repository is used to perform the covariance analysis for a radio tracking science mission to Enceladus. The mission concept is composed of a low-altitude orbiter on a near-circular orbit, and of a set of radio beacons homogeneously spread on the surface of the moon. The spacecraft is connected through a two-way radio link to the radio beacons and to the Earth ground stations.

Three repeating orbits are available.

The following branches are available:
1. **propagator-selection**: the branch stores the scripts used to assess the integration error for a representative dynamical model.
2. **accelerations-selection**: the branch stores the scripts used to assess the physical model error
